            This is a game wrote in python, a version of the famous game, own
            casinos with one or more decks of 52 cards English without
            wildcards, which consists of adding a value as close to 21 without
            going over. In a casino each player at the table plays only against
            the dealer , trying to get a better play than this. The dealer is
            bound by fixed rules that prevent him from making decisions about
            the game. For example, he is forced to ask for a letter whenever his
            score adds up to 16 or less, and forced to stand if he adds up to 17
            or more.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>HIT: </b>is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your
              total and end your turn. If you go over 21 you bust, and the
              dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand. If you are dealt 21
              from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DOUBLE: </b>placing an additional bet to the original, the
              dealer serves the player a single card on the two initials. Every
              casino has rules for this play; Some always allow doubling,
              whatever the first two cards are, others only allow doubling if
              the first two cards add up to 9, 10 or 11.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>STAND: </b>What’s also important is that you know the
              difference between ‘soft’ and ’hard’ hands in blackjack. Hands
              that contain an Ace, which counts as 1 or 11, are called soft
              hands, while hands made up of the other cards are called hard
              hands. Your decision to stand will also be based on which group
              your hand total falls into.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can also make use of other blackjack strategies to win, and
            calculators to help you check probabilities. However, remember that
            certain strategies to play blackjack such as card counting are
            frowned upon and can have you banned at a casino. This technique
            also does not work online as cards are shuffled on every round using
            an automated shoe.

            Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and
            suits don’t matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also important to note, the other players’ hands at the table
            have nothing to do with winning the game of Blackjack like they do
            in Poker games. For all practical purposes, it’s just you against
            the dealer. Unskilled patrons of the game will try to convince you
            “it’s a team sport” but don’t be fooled.

            Blackjack is usually played on a semicircular table that can
            accommodate varying numbers of players. The most common tables
            accommodate 7 players (or seven “spots”) but we’ve seen tables that
            only allow 5 players and other tables that have 12 spots! The dealer
            stands behind the table and chip rack and the players sit on the
            other side.

            This is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to beating
            blackjack. Vegas was built on guys who looked at the wallet-size
            basic strategy a couple times after they bought it in the gift shop
            on their last vacation. It takes intentional practice to commit this
            stuff to memory. If it was easy, we wouldn’t have a website
            dedicated to helping you learn it.

            Once you learn this chart you will have to learn additional

            Blackjack games come with many rule variations and different numbers
            of decks. The most common game of blackjack is dealt out of a 6-deck
            or 8-deck “shoe” (a plastic, card-dispensing device). Single and
            double deck games are still alive and well but not all casinos that
            have blackjack will have single and double deck so the “shoe games”
            are a little more common. Our example will be the procedure for the
            most common blackjack game played with 6 decks. Here is the basic
            overview of a round of blackjack:

            In a game where you can only hope to gain a 1% edge over the house,
            a 99% game isn’t good enough. You need to know these strategy charts
            backwards and forwards, doing a handstand, in a hurricane, giving
            your drink order to a waitress, while listening to Count Von Count

              <b>Main way: </b>The advantage to the casino is reduced by the
              player's ability to see one of the dealer's cards and make
              decisions regarding it. Thus a player can stand 16 or less,
              waiting for the dealer to bust, something the dealer is not
              allowed to do. You can also double the bet when you think your
              cards are favorable with respect to the dealer's visible card, or
              you can unfold the cards when you have two of the same and
              therefore play several hands against the dealer in a hand that you
              consider unfavorable for him. With proper playing strategy, the
              chances of beating the dealer are significantly increased.
              However, studies show that even if the player always plays in the
              most favorable way,
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Second way: </b>In today's blackjack, the casino advantage is
              that the player calls first, with the ability to bust. In the
              event of a check, you automatically lose the bet, eliminating the
              possibility of a tie. Even if the dealer checked too, the player
              would have previously lost, so the casino would have already
              cashed the bet.

            One technique used by some players is card counting. The simplest
            technique is to add +1 for each low card (2 to 6) that reaches the
            table, which benefits the player for the following rounds as there
            is a greater chance of obtaining cards and high scores, or subtract
            -1 for each Ace or card with a value of 10 that reaches the table,
            which hurts the player for the following rounds. The middle cards (7
            to 9) do not add or subtract. When you are on a positive score,
            there are more chances that the player will get a good play, so you
            can bet harder. On the other hand, with a negative score the chances
            of getting a good hand are worse, so the bets should be lower.

            If you’re playing at a casino that offers surrender (also known as
            late surrender or LS), you will only have the option to surrender on
            the first two cards you’re dealt. You won’t be able to surrender if
            you’ve already taken a hit card. This is why surrender is the first
            thing you have to think about when playing your hand. If the answer
            is NO you can’t or NO you shouldn’t surrender, you then ask
            yourself….
